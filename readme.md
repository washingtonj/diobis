Diobis is a job platform created to simplify the job search process by utilizing GitHub repositories as a source of data. We use a personalized and user-friendly UX that removes the complexity and unnecessary information (for the job) that an issue may bring, allowing you to find the best job opportunities directly on GitHub, without the need to navigate through multiple pages.



## Features

 - [ ] Interact with comments and reactions (Like, heart, rocket).
 - [ ] Register and edit job openings directly through the platform.
 - [ ] List access data for each job opening.


#  Application development
